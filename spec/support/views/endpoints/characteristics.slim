h1
  | /api/v1/<strong>characteristics</strong>/graphs/force-directed.json

p This endpoint fetches a list of people and the relationships between them. By default it serves a collection of Venues, Methods, Fields, and Theories.

h2 Optional Parameters

h3 nodes_only

p When set to true, includes "People" and "References" as attributes on each node, rather than listed in links. **This version will include no links.** The purpose is to significantly cut down the size of JSON responses, in exchange for having to do more client-side processing to calculate links.

h4 Example

.well
  | /api/v1/characteristics/graphs/force-directed.json<strong>?nodes_only=true</strong>

h3 only

p Limits the kinds of characteristics returned. It will include a case-insensitive, comma-separated list of "Venues", "Methods", "Fields", and/or "Theories". Including all four of them will result in the same behavior including no parameters.

h4 Example

.well
  | /api/v1/characteristics/graphs/force-directed.json<strong>?only=methods,theories</strong>
