h1
  | /api/v1/<strong>references</strong>/graphs/force-directed.json

p This endpoint fetches a list of references and the relationships between them.

h2 Optional Parameters

h3 nodes_only

p When set to true, includes "Venues", "Methods", "Fields", and "Theories" as attributes on each node, rather than listed in links. **This version will include no links.** The purpose is to significantly cut down the size of JSON responses, in exchange for having to do more client-side processing to calculate links.
